Quality of wine is evaluated by its physical aspects such as taste, odour, aroma, mouth feel and after taste sensations it leaves with the taster. This is a subjective matter changing from people with different taste. This conspicuously cannot be considered as an accurate quality assessment standard. On the contrary, chemical properties do offer more stable and conclusive standards for the quality assessment. In this paper, chemical properties having much influence have been found and worked upon. The pH is found responsible for acidity in wine and other properties such as alcohol concentration which affects the taste of the wine can be assimilated to predict the quality of wine. For the assessment, discriminative model approach is applied used in Machine Learning on the wine data set using Support Vector Machines(SVMs). The results gathered can be used for providing guidance to the wine manufacturers regarding quality of wine and helps in quoting price for the same. Thus, eliminating the inconsistency of wine tasters in quality assessment of wine.
